## Setup

Configure the server executable and the language ids under "Extension Settings".

## "Failed to start server: spawn {command} ENOENT"

If there is a $PATH issue, you have a few options:

1. Run `code .` from a terminal in which the command is available in $PATH.
2. Set PATH in `glspc.environmentVariables` under "Extension Settings".

## Multiple LSP Servers

This extension is currently only able to register one language server. If necessary, you can to build multiple copies of this extension:

```sh
vi package.json  # change the "name", "displayName", and "description" fields
                 # also find/replace "Generic LSP Client"
npm install
npm run package
```

Then you can load it into VSCode under Extensions > ... > Install from VSIX...
